# The deck is divided down the middle to both players (26 cards each)
# Each player removes a card from the top of their deck. This is called a battle.
# The player with the higher card wins the battle and takes both cards.
# If the cards are of the same face value, both players continue to draw until a player loses the battle.
# The cards that are won are placed at the bottom of the deck.

# TODO: Make a dictionary to store the deck.

# TODO: Create a makeDeck() function which creates and initializes the playing deck.
# TODO: Create a draw() function which draws from the top of each player's deck
# TODO: Create a discard() function which puts the cards at the bottom of the player's deck.
# TODO: Create battle(), war() functions which perform the expected action

# TODO: Create a Card class
    # Each card should have a suit
    # Each card should have a value (A, 2, 3, etc.)
# TODO: Create a Suit class


# If there's more to do, divvy it up evenly?
