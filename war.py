# The deck is divided down the middle to both players (26 cards each)
# Each player removes a card from the top of their deck. This is called a battle.
# The player with the higher card wins the battle and takes both cards.
# If the cards are of the same face value, both players continue to draw until a player loses the battle.
# The cards that are won are placed at the bottom of the deck.
